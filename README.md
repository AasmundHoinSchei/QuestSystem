With permission from Reid, I uploaded a quest system based of his tutorials. The purpose is to have a updated version for UE5.
I also added a destroy actor objective which wasnt in the original version.

Press tab to open the quest log.

**Known bugs:**
You need to click on the viewport and then tab to close the quest screen again.
